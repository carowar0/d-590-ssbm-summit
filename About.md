**<h1>What is Melee?</h1>**

Super Smash Bros Melee, often referred to as just melee, is a 2.5D platform fighter that first released in 2001. Despite its age, the game has had a passionate and dedicated competive scene that revolves around a game mode that typically has two players facing off in a head-to-head versus match. Players are given four “lives”, called stocks, and to win you have 8 minutes to take all 4 of your opponent’s stocks before they take yours. In a tournament setting, you need to win 2 out of 3 matches (best of 3) or 3 out of 5 matches (best of 5) to win a set and continue on in the tournament.

**<h1>What is Smash Summit?</h1>**
Smash Summit is like the Olympics for the competitive SSBM scene: the best players are invited to compete in a one-on-one, double elimination tournament to determine who’s the best of the best. Most players qualify for Smash Summit by placing highly at other big tournaments throughout the season, and the rest qualify through crowdfunding. 

**<h1>What is the purpose of this web app?</h1>**
I casually enjoy watching competitive SSBM, and Smash Summit is one of the most entertaining tournaments to watch due to its high production value and great talent. Other statistics-based SSBM websites do exist, such as PG Stats (Panda Global). However, they focus on general summary statistics (overall win rate, ranked wins, etc.) rather than data visualizations or more in-depth statistics. I made this web app to 1) fill a niche, and 2) satisfy my own want to look at statistics for one of my favorite events.
