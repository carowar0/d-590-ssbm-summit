# d-590-ssbm-summit

I created a web app that analyzes the performance of gamers who play Super Smash Bros Melee at Smash Summit, a national invitational tournament series. I obtained my raw data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thomasdubail/super-smash-bros-database, but eventually filtered and transformed it until it became "ss_players.csv". 

My web app has the following functions: 
- the ability to search/filter/sort data from specific Smash Summits, as well as from the players that participated in them
- data visualization for statistics of interest, e.g. a histogram and scatter plot 
- a tool that groups players into a specified number of clusters 
- a decision tree that predicts whether a player will place in the top 8 at a specific Smash Summit
