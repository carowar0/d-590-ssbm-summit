I'm creating a web app that analyzes the performance of gamers who play Super Smash Bros Melee at Smash Summit, a series of national invitational tournaments. 

I plan on creating the following functions for my web app: 
- the ability to search/filter/sort results from specific Smash Summits, as well as from the players that participated in them
- data visualization for summary statistics of interest (e.g. a player's win rate over time, etc.)
- a model that predicts a player's placement in a specific Smash Summit based on their performance at previous tournaments, etc.
